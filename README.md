# HW 4: *3D Stylization*
(using a late day)

## Project Overview:
In this assignment, I turned a 2D concept art piece into a 3D Stylized scene in Unity via stylized graphics techniques and non-physically-based real-time rendering workflows.

# Tasks

## 1. Picking a Piece of Concept Art
I chose work made by @riibirengo

## 2. Interesting Shaders
**Improved Surface Shader**
**Multiple Light Support**

I added multiple light support to my toon shader

***Additional Lighting Feature***

I added a Specular Highlight and Rim Highlight  

***Interesting Shadow***

I added a custom shader with a dotted texture 


***Special Surface Shader***

I added a vertex animation based surface shader to my clouds and flowers to make them wobbly 

## 3. Outlines

I created Post Process Outlines based on Depth and Normal buffers of my scene. I also animated the depth-based outlines.  

## 4. Full Screen Post Process Effect

I added a paper texture and color filters to my scene 

## 5. Create a Scene

I used models from SketchFab 

## 6. Interactivity

Pressing space bar enables "Party mode," which invokes new color shaders as well has faster wobbles
