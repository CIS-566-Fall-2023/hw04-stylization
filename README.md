# Painting in Progress Shader

## Concept Art

Inspired by this painting from the Barnes Foundation in Philly, I worked to recreate the unfinished but elegant painting look using Unity shaders.

## Surface Shaders

Beginning with the three-toned toon shader from the lab, I added adjustments so that the shader supports multiple lights. 

### Additional Feature: Stroke Alpha

I used my own stroke texture, created in Procreate, to blend with the toon shader, creating the unfinished painting look. 
This alpha feature uses the object's UVs and the alpha channel of the shader. 

### Paint Texture Shadow
