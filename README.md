# Project Overview

This project is a small stylization experiment I did for a homework in my Procedural Graphics course at the University of Pennsylvania. It was completed in roughly 5 days.

The original goal was to take a piece of concept art and make a stylized scene in the Unity Engine inspired by that concept art. I took a slightly modified approach

# Breakdown

## Inspirations

1. [This trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfKNOUUtyCA) for the movie Suzume has been something I keep going back to every once in a while. I haven't even seen the movie yet, but the trailer itself is just so aesthetically pleasing! The very first shot of a door is something that I wanted to recreate in some way, and that's where the mysterious door theme came from in this project.

    While Suzume's art style is great, it was a little too complex for such a short project. Rendering grass that looked good and performed well on a WebGL build was a little out of scope - so I looked elsewhere for the general visual art style.

2. [Gris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRiKQIVo7ao) by Nomada Studio uses a very minimalistic, water-coloured, aesthetic with simple outlines, and the analogous colour scheme is very pleasing. This is what I decided to try and replicate.

3. At some point while working on this project, I got inspired to do something with the mysterious doors that was a little more interesting than just scattering a bunch of doors over the scene. I decided to find another art style that would be relatively easy to create with the shaders I had already created, but would still be a stark contrast to the main style. The door would act as a portal from one realm to the other. I found [this artwork by "rudut2015"](https://stock.adobe.com/images/japan-traditional-japanese-painting-sumi-e-art-sun-mountain-sakura-lake/156204903) for this purpose.
