# Stylisation Project: Replicating My Painterly Art Style

## Project Overview:
This project was made for an assignment of creating stylised shaders for my procedural graphics class. I used this opportunity to attempt to replicate my arguably distinct style of artwork with shaders and custom-made 3D models. Every asset that is displayed in this README.md was created by myself.

## 1. Concept Art

The concept art that I am using as inspiration for my project is none other than my own artwork. Long has it been my dream to learn how to convert my 2D style into 3D artwork, and finally, I have the prime opportunity to figure out a medium just on doing so. As my art style has been developing for many years in the making, I will be pointing out a few key featuers of my artwork that defines my signature pieces. Below, I will also be attaching examples of such pieces that highlight the pinnacle of my style.

## 2. Multidirectional Lighting

The first step that I took to implement shaders for my artwork was to add multidirectional lighting. Since I started out this project with a simple three-tone toon shader, my job was to add functionality to sample additional lights that I add on the scene. For that, I added on a custom function that samples additional lights in my toon shader which takes in a world position, normal vector, and a threshold value as an input, and outputs a colour value to be considered for the additional shadows. Adding this colour value to the shader will not do much to change the visual on the shader graph itself, but in the scene, if there is another source of light, there will be another diffuse value calculated for that other light's influence, and that will be considered then in the scope of the additional lighting function. 

To visualise my scene better, I imported an Aranara model that I created, and set up a simple scene with three planes with it. Then, to test the additional lighting, I added some point lights to emulate a simple glow effect to enhance the ambience of my scene in game view. I also created a particle simulation and added lights to them to emulate even more lights, and to add the particles effect that has become a signature in my artworks.

## 3. Outlines
Make your objects pop by adding outlines to your scene! 

Specifically, we'll be creating ***Post Process Outlines*** based on Depth and Normal buffers of our scene!

### To-Do:
1. Render Features! Render Features are awesome, they let us add customizable render passes to any part of the render pipeline. To learn more about them, first, watch the following video which introduces an example usecase of a renderer feature in Unity:
    - [See here](https://youtu.be/GAh225QNpm0?si=XvKqVsvv9Gy1ufi3)
2. Next, let's explore the HW base code briely, and specifically, learn more about the "Full Screen Feature" that's included as part of your base project. There's a small part missing from "Full Screen Feature.cs" that's preventing it from applying any type of full screen shader to the screen. Your job is to solve this bug and in the process, learn how to create a Full Screen Shadergraph, and then have it actually affect the game view! Watch the following video to get a deeper break down of the Render Feature's code and some hints on what the solution may be.
    - [See here for Full Screen Render Feature Debugging Hints/Overview Video](https://youtu.be/Bc9eTlMPdjU)
4. Using what we've learnt about Render Features/URP as a base, let's now get access to the Depth and Normal Buffers of our scene!
    - Unity's Universal Render Pipeline actually already provides us with the option to have a depth buffer, and so obtaining a depth buffer is a very simple/trivial process.
    - This is not the case for a Normal Buffer, and thus, we need a render feature to render out the scene's normals into a render texture. Since the render feature for this has too much syntax specific fluff that's too Unity heavy and not very fun, I've provided a working render feature that renders objects' normals into a render texture in the /Render Features folder, called the "Normal Feature." There is also a shader provided, "Hidden/Normal Copy" or "Normal Copy.shader."
        - Your task is to add the Normal Feature to the render pipeline, make a material off of the Normal Copy shader and then plug it into the Normal Feature, and finally, connect the render texture called "Normal Buffer" located in the "/Buffers" directory as the destination target for the render feature.
            - Set the resolution of the Normal Buffer render texture to be equal to your game window resolution.
    - Watch the following video for clarifications on both of these processes, and also, how to actually access and read the depth and normal buffers once we've created them.
        - [See here for complete tutorial video on Depth and Normal Buffers](https://youtu.be/giLPZA-xAXk)

5. Finally, using everything you've learnt about Render Features alongside the fact that we now have proper access to both Depth and Normal Buffers, let's create a Post Process Outline Shader!
    - We **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** watching at least one of these Incredibly Useful Tutorials before getting started on Outlines:
        - [NedMakesGames](https://www.youtube.com/@NedMakesGames)
            - [Tutorial on Depth Buffer Sobel Edge Detection Outlines in Unity URP](https://youtu.be/RMt6DcaMxcE?si=WI7H5zyECoaqBsqF)
        - [Robin Seibold](https://www.youtube.com/@RobinSeibold)
            -  [Tutorial on Depth and Normal Buffer Robert's Cross Outliens in Unity](https://youtu.be/LMqio9NsqmM?si=zmtWxtdb1ViG2tFs)
        - [Alexander Ameye](https://ameye.dev/about/)
            - [Article on Edge Detection Post Process Outlines in Unity](https://ameye.dev/notes/edge-detection-outlines/)
        - **Important Clarification/Note on the Tutorials:**
            - You will quickly notice after watching/reading any of these tutorials that many of them use a Render Feature to render out a single DepthNormals Texture that encodes both depth and normal information into a single texture. This optimization saves on performance but results in less accurate depth or normals information and is overall more confusing for a first time experience into Render Features. Thus, for this assignment, we will just be sticking to our approach of having separate Depth and Normal buffers.
   
    - Next, we will create a basic Depth and Normal based outline prototype that produces black outlines at areas of large depth and normal difference across the screen.
            - Explore different kinds of edge detection methods, including Sobel and Robert's Cross filters
            - Make sure the outline has adjustable parameters, such as width. 
    - Let's get creative! Modify your outline to be ANIMATED and to have an appearance that resembles the outlines in your concept art / OR, if the outlines in your concept art are too plain, try to make your outline resemble crayon/pencil sketching/etc.
        - Use your knowledge of toolbox functions to add some wobble, or warping or noise onto the lines that changes over time.
        - In my example below, you might be able to notice that the internal Normal Buffer based edges actually don't have any warping/animation. I did this intentionally because I wanted the final look to still have some kind of structure. Thus, by doing the depth and normal outlines in separate passes, I'm able to have a variety of animated/non-animated outlines composited together : ) !

7. (OPTIONAL) If you're not satisfied with the look of your outlines and are looking for an extra challenge, after implementing depth/normal based post processing, you may explore non-post process techniques such as inverse hull edge rendering for outer edges to render bolder, more solid looking outlines for a different look.

## 4. Full Screen Post Process Effect
We're nearing the end! 

### To-Do:
Ok, now regardless of what your concept art looks like, using what you know about toolbox functions and screen space effects, add an appealing post-process effect to give your scene a unique look. Your post processing effect should do at least one of the following.
* A vingette that darkens the edges of your images with a color or pattern
* Color / tone mapping that changes the colorization of your renders. [Here's some basic ideas, but please experiment](https://gmshaders.com/tutorials/basic_colors/) 
* A texture to make your image look like it's drawn on paper or some other surface.
* A blur to make your image look smudged.
* Fog or clouds that drift over your scene
* Whatever else you can think of that complements your scene!

***Note: This should be easily accomplishable using what you should have already learnt about working with Unity's Custom Render Features from the Outline section!***

---
## 5. Create a Scene
Using Unity's controls, create a ***SUPER BASIC*** scene with a few elements to show off your unique rendering stylization. Be sure to apply the materials you've created. Please don't go crazy with the geometry -- then you'll have github problems if your files are too large. [See here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github). 

Note that your modelling will NOT be graded at all for this assignment. It is **NOT** expected that your scene will be a one-to-one faithful replica of your concept art. You are **STRONGLY ENCOURAGED** to find free assets online, even if they don't strongly resemble the geometry/objects present in your concept art. (TLDR; If you choose to model your own geometry for this project, be aware of the time-constraint and risk!)

Some example resources for finding 3D assets to populate your scene With:
1. [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/)
2. [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/)
3. [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/)

## 6. Interactivity
As a finishing touch, let's show off the fact that our scene is rendered in real-time! Please add an element of interactivity to your scene. Change some major visual aspect of your scene on a keypress. The triggered change could be
* Party mode (things speed up, different colorization)
* Memory mode (different post-processing effects to color you scene differently)
* Fanart mode (different surface shaders, as if done by a different artist)
* Whatever else you can think of! Combine these ideas, or come up with something new. Just note, your interactive change should be at least as complex as implementing a new type of post processing effect or surface shader. We'll be disappointed if its just a parameter change. There should be significant visual change.

### To-Do:
* Create at least one new material to be swapped in using a key press
* Create and attach a new C# script that listens for a key press and swaps out the material on that key press. 
Your C# script should look something like this:
```
public Material[] materials;
private MeshRenderer meshRenderer;
int index;

void Start () {
          meshRenderer = GetComponent<MeshRenderer>();
}

void Update () {
          if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space)){
                 index = (index + 1) % materials.Count;
                 SwapToNextMaterial(index);
          }
}

void SwapToNextMaterial (int index) {
          meshRenderer.material = materials[index % materials.Count];
}
```
* Attach the c# script as a component to the object(s) that you want to change on keypress
* Assign all the relevant materials to the Materials list field so you object knows what to swap between.

## 7. Extra Credit
Explore! What else can you do to polish your scene?
  
- Implement Texture Support for your Toon Surface Shader with Appealing Procedural Coloring.
    - I.e. The procedural coloring needs to be more than just multiplying by 0.6 or 1.5 to decrease/increase the value. Consider more deeply the relationship between things such as value and saturation in artist-crafted color palettes? 
- Add an interesting terrain with grass and/or other interesting features
- Implement a Custom Skybox alongside a day-night cycle lighting script that changes the main directional light's colors and direction over time.
- Add water puddles with screenspace reflections!
- Any other similar level of extra spice to your scene : ) (Evaluated on a case-by-case basis by TAs/Rachel/Adam)
