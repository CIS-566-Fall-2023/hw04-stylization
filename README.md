## Accomplishments (thanks to the Academy)

- multi-light toon shader with separate quantizations
- textured shadow/midtone/highlight transitions using LinearAddSub mixture node and an animated shadow texture
  - allows switching between uv space and screen space!
- animated egg yolk with vertex shader using sin + steps (posterize) + parameterized speed, amplitude, and step count
- bugfix in fullscreen render feature
- normal and depth buffers both used in render feature to add thick outlines, also using shadow texture (inverted) in screen space
- full screen wobbly effect added with layered fbm (3 octaves)
- beautiful toast scene with floating toasts
- party mode (press space!) which remembers old material properties and allows toggling back and forth
